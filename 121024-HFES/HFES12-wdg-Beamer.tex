\documentclass[usenames,dvipsnames]{beamer}
%% wdg KOOL - I can add options here for packages like xcolor and color that Beamer automatically loads

%%% HOW TO PRODUCE HANDOUTS %%%%%

%%%		beamer modes: handout, 
%%% Removing overlays from a beamer presentation is easily done within the preamble, by adding the handout option:
%\documentclass[handout,xcolor=pdftex,dvipsnames,table]{beamer}
% Once overlays have been removed, putting multiple frames onto a single sheet of paper is a separate problem related to PDF Ô¨Åles. The pdfpages package [4], for example, solves this problem. For an automated approach based on the same package, pdfjam [1], a Unix shell script, can be used.

%%% PACKAGES LOADED IN BY BEAMER
%%%		amsthm %%use noamsthm to suppress loading this -- see p16 of beameruserguide (BUG)
%%%		color - also xcolor is loaded
%%%		enumerate %% loaded in the presentation modes but not in the article mode
%%%		hyperref   %% to pass additional options to beamer use the following class options: \documentclass[hyperref={<list-of-options}]{beamer}
%%%		for HANDOUTS recommended that you use beamer with the document class article
	%%% \documentclass[<options>]{article}
	%%%	\usepackage[<options>]{beamerarticle}

\section{Other Visions}
\begin{frame}[label=sampleAgainframe]
	\frametitle{OTHER VISIONS OF MODELS: \emph{McClelland, 2009}}
	``The essential purpose of cognitive modeling is to allow investigation of the implications of ideas, beyond the limits of human thinking.
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Models allow the exploration of the implications of ideas that cannot be fully explored by thought alone.
		\item As such, they are vehicles for scientific discovery, in much the same way as experiments on human (or other) participants. 
		\item But the discoveries take a particular form: A system with a particular set of specified properties has another set of properties that arise from those in the specified set as consequences.
		\item From observations of this type, we then attempt to draw implications for the nature of human cognition'' \parencite{mcclelland09topiCS}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{textblock}{8}(1,13)

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{IMPORTANCE OF SIMPLIFICATION -- from McClelland, 2009}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item ``\textcite{borges98exactitude} describes a town where there are mapmakers who are obsessed with verisimilitude in their mapmaking
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Each strives to outdo the others in making his maps more detailed and realistic. Some mapmakers are criticized because their maps are too small--their scale prevents recording of many details. Others are criticized for schematic rendering of roads and intersections.
			\item The consequence is the construction of huge, life-size maps, which, of course, are completely useless because use of such a map is no easier than direct exploration of the real space that the map represents.
		\end{itemize}
		\item When it comes to mapmaking, simplification is evidently crucial--the point of the map is to offer a guide, rather than a replication, of reality.''

	\end{textblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{MORE MCCLELLAND}
The point is simply this: 
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item Simplification is essential, but it comes at a cost, and real understanding
depends in part on understanding the effects of the simplification. 
		\item Unfortunately, this can mean that further exploration becomes more technical and complex as a result.
			\item Trying hard to add just enough additional complexity can help. Learning what simplification is the best one to use is also a part of the process. Some simplifications do a better job retaining essential properties of a process than others.
