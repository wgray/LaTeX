\documentclass[usenames,dvipsnames]{beamer}
%% wdg KOOL - I can add options here for packages like xcolor and color that Beamer automatically loads

%%% HOW TO PRODUCE HANDOUTS %%%%%

%%%		beamer modes: handout, 
%%% Removing overlays from a beamer presentation is easily done within the preamble, by adding the handout option:
%\documentclass[handout,xcolor=pdftex,dvipsnames,table]{beamer}
% Once overlays have been removed, putting multiple frames onto a single sheet of paper is a separate problem related to PDF Ô¨Åles. The pdfpages package [4], for example, solves this problem. For an automated approach based on the same package, pdfjam [1], a Unix shell script, can be used.

%%% PACKAGES LOADED IN BY BEAMER
%%%		amsthm %%use noamsthm to suppress loading this -- see p16 of beameruserguide (BUG)
%%%		color - also xcolor is loaded
%%%		enumerate %% loaded in the presentation modes but not in the article mode
%%%		hyperref   %% to pass additional options to beamer use the following class options: \documentclass[hyperref={<list-of-options}]{beamer}
%%%		for HANDOUTS recommended that you use beamer with the document class article
	%%% \documentclass[<options>]{article}
	%%%	\usepackage[<options>]{beamerarticle}
	%%%	--- see the BUG for more details, pp206
%%%		xcolor - also color is loaded

\setbeamercovered{transparent} %% having this on should make all not-yet-uncovered-text transparent
%% {\setbeamercovered{invisible}{ \begin{frame} . . . \end{frame} }} - as a wrapper to turn off the transparent mode for one frame. Used in my 121011-ONR-SF_rvw presentation for the Just-Manageable-Complexity frame - which has graphics

\usepackage[absolute,overlay]{textpos}
%%%		beamer automatically installs a white background behind everything, unless you install a different background template. Because of this, you must use the overlay option when using textpos, so that it will place boxes in front of everything.
